There are 275 features and 10000 samples in the training data
After transformation by radial basis functions the training data now has dimensions of (10000, 500)
Plus the identity basis the training data has dimensions of (10000, 775)
The penalty given by the regression algorithm is 0.1
On the training data set the average error of prediction is 0.148352429848
After transformation by radial basis functions the testing data now has dimensions of (5000, 500)
Plus the identity basis the testing data has dimensions of (5000, 775)
On the testing data set the average error of prediction is 0.160467708426
